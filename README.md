# Hi there! I'm Ratanon Suksumrun 👋

I'm a **Project Manager** focused on driving digital transformation in **FinTech and Enterprise** environments. With over 5 years of experience in cross-functional team coordination, data-driven solutions, and agile transformation initiatives, I specialize in bridging the gap between technical teams and business objectives to deliver measurable impact.

## About Me

I'm an experienced leader who thrives on leading complex digital transformation initiatives in the fintech and enterprise sectors. My background combines strong project management capabilities with a deep understanding of data analytics and enterprise systems integration. I'm particularly skilled at stakeholder alignment, managing cross-functional teams through agile methodologies, and translating technical capabilities into business value.

## What I Do

Currently, I'm a **Project Manager at Omise**, where I'm leading fintech transformation initiatives with over **$300K in annual impact**. I recently delivered the **Report Engine project**, securing a significant annual contract to enhance merchant reporting capabilities, and coordinated cross-functional teams on the **CYBS REST API rollout** for Thai banks—a project that drove approximately **$150K/month in savings** through TikTok Ads/Live migration to KBank Cybs.

Before joining Omise, I spent nearly five years at **Indorama Ventures** as a **Digital Project Manager**, where I spearheaded data integration and analytics transformation. I managed the implementation of Workday's Adaptive Planning module, contributed to procurement analytics solution design with enhanced data warehouse capabilities, developed user-centric Tableau dashboards for improved decision-making, and served as a key liaison managing vendor partnerships for supply chain analytics software.

## Background

I hold an **MSc in Advanced Chemical Engineering with Process Systems Engineering** from **Imperial College London** and a **BEng (Hons) in Chemical Engineering** from **Lancaster University**, where I graduated with First Class Honours and became a member of the Institution of Chemical Engineers. While my formal education is rooted in engineering, my career has evolved toward digital transformation, project management, and data-driven business solutions.

## Technical Toolkit

I work across a diverse range of tools and platforms. For data work, I use **Python, R, SQL, and Tableau** for analysis and insights. For visualization and reporting, I leverage **Tableau, Excel, and custom dashboard design**. On the project management side, I'm experienced with **Jira, Confluence, Asana, and Miro**. I'm also well-versed in enterprise platforms including **SAP, Workday, and Google Sheets**.
