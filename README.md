# A little bit about my professional and university life

Hey everyone! I'm Ratanon Suksumrun (please call me Tap since it's easier and it's also my nickname!). I"m a data analyst at Indorama Ventures PCL under the Strategy, Planning and Investor Relations department. My main line of work is to leverage data analytics tools and techniques to devise apporpriate strategies from the data. This is doone by capturing data sources, clean/validate the data and integrate onto Tableau. The resulting views and dashboards will then be used for analysis purposes. 

I started creating a GitHub profile after the completion of my dissertation project at Imperial College London, where my project was about formulating a probabilistic methane emissions model via R as the nature of the project was heavily-reliant on the use of statistics. The purpose of the code is to conduct a techno-economic assessment on mitigating methane emissions in the natural gas supply chain in Alberta, Canada.
